title: "Kazelle Care "

  Kazelle care started as a hobby that blossomed into a business operated  by
  Kazelle Johnson-Lewis a native daughter of the soil from Village Road
  Grenville, St. Andrews. Having migrated to the USA at age 16 after graduating
  from SJC Grenville, Kazelle gravitated to the natural skin care remedies such
  as aloes, cocoa butter, organic oils,  to help combat the change in weather
  that the climate of the US had on her skin  which is prominently featured in
  the kazelle care skincare line  sourced from Grenada.


  Kazelle care aspires to bring variety of soaps and bath washes with current favorites being the lemongrass eucalyptus and lavender bath wash, honey and lime soap bar and the honey oatmeal bar which has been good for those with eczema, and  quality bath oils which helps to moisturize, remove marks and blemishes and also keep insects such as mosquitoes at bay. Kazelle’s  personal favorite is the body balm scented in cocoa butter with a slight hint of vanilla musk. Through this skincare company, Kazelle intends to give back to Grenada in ways that fosters continued growth and development of the youth. 


  As such Kazelle Care has teamed up with the Ann Alexander scholarship fund and the  HEON Project  and have been donating laptops to the awardees for the past two years which assists in the recipients’ successful completion of college. This generosity has been learnt from my grandmother (Ann Alexander)  and the culture she has provided to us, through giving.
